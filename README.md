# AutoWaterPump ðŸŒ±ðŸ’§

An Arduino-based automatic plant watering system with smart monitoring, scheduling, and manual control features.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

The AutoWaterPump is an intelligent plant watering system built on Arduino Uno that monitors soil moisture levels and automatically waters plants based on configurable schedules and thresholds. It features an LCD display, menu system, and multiple sensors to ensure optimal plant care.

In this project, I focused on the hardware side. I learned soldering, reading and designing electrical schematics, working with sensor channels, and building stable circuits on perfboards. I also learned so much more on saving and managing memory through little things like using the right data types.

Learning computer architecture and assembly language helped me understand how to optimize the code for better performance and memory usage. This project was a great way to apply those concepts in a practical setting. (I learned how to [disassemble LC4 object files](https://gitfront.io/r/quiyetbrul/hrpHZyirTkfn/lc4-disassembler/) using C, converting machine code back into human-readable assembly instructions.)
